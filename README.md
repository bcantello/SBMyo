Orofacial "mouth and face" myofunctional "muscle function" therapy (OMT) is a neuromuscular re-education of the oral and facial muscles.

The overarching goal is to restore normal function by correcting improper muscle movements, teaching correct chewing, swallowing and breathing patterns, and improving airway health.
