                    <h2>What is Myofunctional Therapy?</h2>
                    <p>Orofacial "mouth and face" myofunctional "muscle function" therapy (OMT) is a neuromuscular re-education of the oral and facial muscles. Itâ€™s done through a series of tailored exercises, awareness and reduction of muscle compensations. The overarching goal is to restore normal function by correcting improper muscle movements, teaching correct chewing, swallowing and breathing patterns, and improving airway health.</p>
                    <h2>This therapy is used to manage a variety of disorders including:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tongue tie</li>
                        <li>Tongue thrust</li>
                        <li>Low tongue posture/open mouth posture</li>
                        <li>Anterior open bite</li>
                        <li>Grinding and clenching</li>
                        <li>TMJ pain</li>
                        <li>Snoring/sleep apnea</li>
                        <li>Chronic headaches/neck pain</li>
                        <li>GERD</li>
                        <li>Chronic bloating/gas</li>
                        <li>Habit elimination such as thumb sucking/nail biting</li>
                        <li>Chronic fatigue/waking up tired</li>
                        <li>Anxiety</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These dysfunctions can significantly affect sleep quality, dentition, chewing, swallowing, speech and overall mental and physical health including hormone regulation, growth, attention span and more.</p><br/>
                    <p>Myofunctional therapy is for everyone, both children and adults. It is completely non-invasive and can be instrumental in re-training the muscles of the face and tongue that have been in dysfunction for years. Restoring normal function to the tongue and facial muscles can have full body benefits.</p>
