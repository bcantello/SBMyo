                <h2>What is Myofunctional Therapy?</h2>
                <p>Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy (OMT) is a neuromuscular re-education of the oral and facial muscles. Itâ€™s done through a series of tailored exercises, awareness and reduction of muscle compensations. The overarching goal is to restore normal function by correcting improper muscle movements, teaching correct chewing, swallowing and breathing patterns, and improving airway health.</p>
